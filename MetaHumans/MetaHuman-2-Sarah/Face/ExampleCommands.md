Command that loads Sarah (which applies her default face texture):
PRS.Fem1

Command that would send your modified face texture into the game:
OFCD_Face_https://your-image-host.com/your_custom_sarah_face.png

Note: The OFCD_Face_ command must sometimes be sent twice back-to-back (workaround for Unreal not always processing the first command).
